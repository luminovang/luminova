# About Luminova!

Luminova is a PHP framework built for speed and efficiency, designed to enhance your existing coding skills. At Luminova, we prioritize performance and offer feature customization through the `env` file, ensuring that you only include what you need for your specific project. This approach allows you to enable only the necessary features and choose how you want your template rendering and implementation to look.

By default, we provide access to the `Template` object within your views, enabling the use of the `$this` keyword within template files. This can be disabled if you prefer your views to be rendered in isolation, using the custom keyword `$self` to access application objects.

To get started with Luminova, please visit our [official documentation](https://luminova.ng/docs).
